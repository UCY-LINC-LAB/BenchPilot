BenchPilot provides a high-level declarative model for describing experiment testbeds and scenarios that automates the benchmarking process on Streaming Distributed Processing Engines (SDPEs). The latter enables users to focus on performance analysis instead of dealing with the complex and time-consuming setup. BenchPilot instantiates the underlying cluster, performs repeatable experimentation, and provides a unified monitoring stack in heterogeneous Micro-DCs.\nExperiment Setup #  A typical workflow starts with the user submitting in a yaml file their choice of experiments and their specific parameters. The BenchPilot model is composed with Experiments, where Workloads are described. Each workload can have the following:\n name, which will be selected from the supported workload list. record name, so that the user can later on retrieve its monitored metrics based on it number of repetitions, duration, specific workload parameters, cluster configurations including the manager node\u0026rsquo;s IP, list of cluster nodes, etc. engine configurations, in case of streaming distributed-based workloads  Deployment #  When the description is ready, the user deploys the application using the BenchPilotSDK through a Jupyter notebook. If there\u0026rsquo;s no validation error from the description, the Parser will parse the preferences to the BenchPilot Deployment Template Generator, where the preferences will be transformed into docker-compose templates. At last, the Deployment Coordinator will deploy each experiment to the underlying orchestrator and closely monitor its performance through the monitoring stack. At the beginning and end of each experiment, the Coordinator records the starting/ending timestamps, so that the user can retrieve the monitored information later on.\nMonitoring #  For extracting various infrastructure utilization metrics, including CPU, Memory, and Network Utilization, BenchPilot offers a transparent, from the application under test, monitoring stack. To achieve this, BenchPilot, in the bootstrapping stage, instantiates a containerized monitoring agent on every node. The agent inspects system information (e.g., performance pseudofiles and cgroup files) and extracts the required metrics in a non-intrusive way. The agent starts various probes, one for each sub-component (e.g., cgroup probe, OS probe, etc.), and exposes an API through which a centralized monitoring server retrieves the data periodically and stores them to the monitoring storage. Furthermore, the monitoring agent offers probes for external resources as well. From the implementation perspective, we have selected Netdata, a widely known and used monitoring tool, and Prometheus, an open-source and popular monitoring server, for our stack. For a monitoring storage backend, InfluxDB is used.\nPost-Experiment Analysis #  To create an end-to-end interactive analytic tool for benchmarking, BenchPilot utilizes the Jupyter Notebook stack. Specifically, after the experimentation process is over, the user can request the monitored metrics of each execution from the monitoring storage based on the provided experiments\u0026rsquo; starting/ending timestamps. Users can apply high-level analytic models to the retrieved metrics of each experiment and have a clear overview of their deployments. Workload List #  As for now BenchPilot only supports the following containerized workloads:\n   Name Description Specific Configuration Parameters     marketing-campaign A streaming distributed workload that features an application as a data processing pipeline with multiple and diverse steps that emulate insight extraction from marketing campaigns. The workload utilizes technologies such as Kafka and Redis. campaigns, which is the number of campaigns, the default number is 1000, tuples_per_second, the number of emitted tuples per second, the default is 10000 kafka_event_count, the number of generated and published events on kafka, the default is 1000000 maximize_data, this attribute is used to automatically maximize the data that are critically affecting the workload\u0026rsquo;s performance, the input that the user can put is in the format of x10, x100, etc.    It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that BenchPilot can be easily extended to add new workloads.\nEngine Parameters #  In the case of streaming distributed workloads, the user needs to define specific engine parameters along with their experiment declaration. The structure should be as the example below:\n engine:  name: \u0026#34;storm\u0026#34;  parameters:  partitions: 5  ackers: 2  executors_per_node: [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 16 ] For each Streaming Distributed Processing Engine, the following attributes can be specified:\nEngine Storm Flink Spark   Parameters partitionsackersexecutors_per_node partitionsbuffer_timeoutcheckpoint_interval partitionsbatchtimeexecutor_coresexecutor_memory   Resources #  The Team #  The creators of the BenchPilot are members of the Laboratory for Internet Computing (LInC), University of Cyprus.
